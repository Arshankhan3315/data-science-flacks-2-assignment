    "1-Purpose: The primary purpose of the GET method is to request data from a specified resource. It is used to retrieve information without causing any side effects on the server or modifying data on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Data in URL: In a GET request, data is appended to the URL as query parameters. This means that the data is visible in the URL, which can be a security concern when dealing with sensitive information.\n",

    "3-Caching: GET requests can be cached by web browsers and intermediaries (like proxies), which can lead to improved performance when requesting the same resource multiple times.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "3-Not Cached: POST requests are not cached by web browsers or intermediaries by default because they are typically associated with actions that change server state.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "6-Example: When you submit a registration form on a website, the data you enter (e.g., username and password) is typically sent to the server using a POST request, which then processes the data and creates a new user account."
